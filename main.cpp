// Hey guys, so my plan is to have this file be a master file which will call the map class and graph classes itself depending on which is prefered.
// My idea is the UI code can hopefully call/trigger this class and it's methods itself (not sure how that works)

#include "mapClass.h"

public int main(bool useMap) {
    if (useMap) { // Use the map data structure

    } else { // Use the graph data structure
        // TODO
    }
}
